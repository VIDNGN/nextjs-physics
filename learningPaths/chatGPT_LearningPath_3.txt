### Personalized Learning Plan for Math and Mechanics

**Goal**: Build foundational math skills to confidently apply concepts in mechanics while improving consistency in studying.

---

#### Stage 1: Strengthening Basic Math Skills (Weeks 1-3)

**Topics**:
- Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
- Fractions and Decimals
- Basic Algebra (solving simple equations)

**Activities**:
- **Nightly Practice**: Spend 10 mins on arithmetic exercises (online worksheets or apps like Khan Academy).
- **Concept Application**: Use everyday scenarios (like cooking or shopping) to apply math concepts.
- **Flashcards**: Create flashcards for basic math facts and practice for 5 mins.

**Measurement of Progress**: Take a mini quiz every 3 days to assess improvement.

#### Stage 2: Introductory Mechanics (Weeks 4-6)

**Topics**:
- Forces and Motion (Newtonâ€™s Laws)
- Basic Concepts of Speed, Velocity, and Acceleration
- Simple Machines (levers, pulleys)

**Activities**:
- **Reading**: Watch short videos about each topic (SciShow Kids, Crash Course).
- **Practical Application**: Conduct simple experiments (e.g., rolling objects down a ramp) to observe forces in action.
- **Problem-solving**: Solve basic mechanics problems (available in textbooks or online).

**Measurement of Progress**: Conduct a simple experiment weekly and write a few sentences on your observations.

#### Stage 3: Applying Math to Mechanics (Weeks 7-10)

**Topics**:
- Using Algebra in Mechanics
- Understanding and Calculating Forces with Equations
- Simple Calculations involving Speed and Acceleration

**Activities**:
- **Math Application**: Solve mechanics problems that involve basic math (using worksheets).
- **Games**: Use interactive physics games to reinforce concepts while making learning fun.
- **Consistency Tracker**: Keep a daily log of what you learn each night to encourage consistency and track progress.

**Measurement of Progress**: Attempt a basic mechanics problem set at the end of this stage.
