      '\n' +
      '### **Stage 1: Foundational Learning (Weeks 1-2)**\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Focus**: Basic Arithmetic & Understanding Mechanics Concepts\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Topics**:\n' +
      '- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division\n' +
      '- Introduction to mechanics (concepts like force, motion)\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Activities**:\n' +
      '- **Math (10 min)**: Use online resources or apps (like Khan Academy) to practice basic arithmetic problems. Aim for 5-10 practice problems each night.\n' +
      '- **Science (10 min)**: Watch a short YouTube video (5-7 mins) explaining key mechanics concepts, then summarize what you learned in 3-5 sentences.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Consistency Strategy**: Create a learning schedule on a calendar. Mark each day you complete your session to visualize progress.\n' +
      '\n' +

      '\n' +
      '### **Stage 2: Intermediate Skills (Weeks 3-4)**\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Focus**: Applying Math Skills to Mechanics\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Topics**:\n' +
      '- Unit conversions and basic geometry (area, perimeter)\n' +
      "- Basic laws of mechanics (Newton's laws)\n" +
      '\n' +
      '**Activities**:\n' +
      '- **Math (10 min)**: Solve practical problems involving unit conversions and area calculations (e.g., calculating the area of a rectangle). Aim for 3-5 problems focused on real-world applications.\n' +
      "- **Science (10 min)**: Conduct simple experiments (like measuring the drop of a ball) and document the results, connecting the experiment to Newton's laws.\n" +
      '\n' +
      '**Consistency Strategy**: Use a reward system for completing each week’s learning. For example, treat yourself on weekends when you complete all sessions.\n' +
      '\n' +

      '\n' +
      '### **Stage 3: Application and Problem Solving (Weeks 5-6)**\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Focus**: Strengthening Concept Application in Real-World Scenarios\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Topics**:\n' +
      '- Algebra basics (solving for x)\n' +
      '- Problem-solving with mechanics (calculating speed, distance, and time)\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Activities**:\n' +
      '- **Math (10 min)**: Complete problems that involve setting up equations and solving for unknowns, with a focus on word problems.\n' +
      '- **Science (10 min)**: Create a mini-project (like building a simple structure) to apply mechanics concepts. Document the process and the principles involved.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Consistency Strategy**: Join an online study group or forum to discuss concepts with peers. Set a specific goal for contributions (e.g., one question answered per week).\n' +
      '\n' +
      '---\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### **Stage 4: Review and Deepening Knowledge (Weeks 7-8)**\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Focus**: Mastery through Revisiting Concepts and Advanced Applications\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Topics**:\n' +
      '- Review key math concepts (addition, subtraction, multiplying units)\n' +
      '- Deeper exploration into forces and motion (e.g., friction, gravity)\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Activities**:\n' +
      '- **Math (10 min)**: Take quizzes that cover all previously learned math concepts and mechanics applications.\n' +
      '- **Science (10 min)**: Read a short article or chapter about advanced mechanics concepts and relate them to previous learnings. Write a brief reflection on how understanding these concepts can apply to everyday situations.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Consistency Strategy**: Set small, achievable objectives for each night (e.g., complete one quiz, read one article). Re-evaluate progress at the end of the 8 weeks and adjust the learning plan if necessary.\n' +
