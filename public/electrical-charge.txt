electricity plays an important role in our modern world: computers, power, motors, lights. At the most fundamental level, electricity is the movement of charged particles, in a conductor, like a wire, in response to forces such as electric fields. On a more abstract level, electricity is the manifestation of the electromagnetic forces between atoms, molecules, and charged particles (like protons and electrons), driving everything from basic chemical reactions to the metabolic processes of our body and the technology we use daily. Many of the forces we encounter daily, such as friction, tension, elastic forces, with the exception of gravity, is the result of electric forces acting at the atomic level in the most harmonious and perfect balance.


Most objects in our visible and tangible world in electrical neutrality conceals their content of positive and negative "matter," which we call positive and negative charges. Only when this neutrality is disturbed does nature reveal to us the effects of imbalance of positive or negative charge. When a body is "charged" it means it has an imbalance of negative and positive charges. Charged bodies exert forces on each other. How? each type of charge repels the same type but attracts the opposite type. That is, unlike charges attract and like charges repel.

You may know, of course, that atoms are made of positive protons in the nucleus and with electrons outside.  

The word electricity comes from the Greek word elektron, which means "amber"? Amber is fossilized tree resin, and the ancients knew that if you rub an amber rod with a piece of cloth, the amber attracts small pieces of leaves or dust. 
To show this, we will explore an electrical interaction demonstration, so hopefully, you'll be ready to roll up your sleeves and dive in!
You'll see there are two kinds of charge, which we can call positve and negative. The simple 'experiment' can be explained with: 
Like charges repel and opposite kinds attract.
All matter is a mixture of positve protons and negative electrons which are attracting and repelling with this great force called electrical force. How big is this force compared to gravitation? It is about a few billion times stronger!
