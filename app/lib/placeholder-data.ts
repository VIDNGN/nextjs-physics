        'Consider a force like gravitation, which varies predominantly inversely with the square of the distance, but is about a billion-billion-billion-billion times stronger. There is another key difference: there are two kinds of "matter," which we can call positive and negative. Like kinds repel, and unlike kinds attractâ€”unlike gravity, which involves only attraction. What would happen in this scenario? A bunch of positives would repel each other with enormous force and spread out in all directions. A bunch of negatives would do the same. However, an evenly mixed bunch of positives and negatives would behave differently. The opposite charges would attract each other with great force, resulting in a balanced state. The net effect would be that these strong forces would almost perfectly cancel each other out by forming tight, fine mixtures of positive and negative particles. Between two separate bunches of such mixtures, there would be practically no attraction or repulsion at all. This force exists: the electrical force. All matter is a mixture of positive protons and negative electrons, which attract and repel each other with this great force.'

      content: 'He was born on 14 June 1736 and died on 23 August 1806, was a French officer, engineer, and physicist. He is best known as the eponymous discoverer of what is now called Coulombs Law, the description of the electrostatic force of attraction and repulsion. He also did important work on friction. The SI unit of electric charge, the coulomb, was named in his honor in 1880.[2]'

      content: 'There is only one precise way of present the laws, and that is by means of differential equations. They ahve athe advantage of being fundamental and, so far as we know, precise. But the equations are complicated, after all they are only mathemathical equations and if I understand them mathematically inside out, I will understand the physics inside out. Only it doesn\'t work that way. People who think that way fail because the actual physical situations in the real world are so complicated that it is necessary to have a much broader understanding of the equations. What it means to understand an equation in more than a strictly mathematical sense - was described by Diract. He said, "I understand what an equation means if I ahve a way of figuring out the characteristics of its solution wihtout actually solving it." So if we have a way of knowing what should happen in given circumstances without actually solving the equations, then we "understand" the equations, as applied to these circumstances. A physical understanding is a completely unmathematical, imprecise, and inexact thing, but absolutely necessary for a physicist.'
